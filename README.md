# The Content Shock Doctrine

Most “content strategies” are just playbooks written for slide decks.  
They don’t move the needle — they add to the noise.  

**The Content Shock Doctrine** is a no-BS framework for building content that actually resonates, provokes, and cuts through.

## Core principles

### 1. Authenticity over polish
If you wouldn’t say it over a beer, don’t publish it.  
Stories beat stats. Real voices beat corporate accents.

### 2. Audience reality > persona theater
Stop inventing “Steve the CTO.”  
Look at support tickets, Reddit threads, and rants. Pain drives clicks, not demographics.

### 3. Flexible pillars
Content pillars aren’t forever. Kill what’s stale. Treat pillars as launchpads, not cages.

### 4. Own your distribution
Don’t pray to algorithms. Build your own channels: email, communities, partnerships.  
Repurpose aggressively.

### 5. Data as signal, not leash
Dashboards show the past. Strategy requires experiments.  
Let data inform, not dictate.

### 6. Iterate fast
Ship at 70%. Learn in the wild. Cull what flops, double down on what sticks.  
Perfectionism is just fear in disguise.

### 7. Disrupt or die boring
Best practices = invisibility.  
Say the quiet part out loud. Make people squirm. Attention follows courage.

## The doctrine in one line

Content strategy isn’t a framework — it’s a fight.  
Until you stop creating for algorithms and start creating for humans,  
you’re not building strategy — you’re just adding noise.
